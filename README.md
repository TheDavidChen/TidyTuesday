# TidyTuesday

[Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project/challenge from the R4DS online learning community, where the goal is to process and visualize a dataset. Emphasis is placed on data wrangling and visualization skills, especially with packages such as `ggplot2` and `dplyr` from the `tidyverse` ecosystem. 

This repo formatting is based on [CÃ©dric Scherer's repo](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/master/README.md).
